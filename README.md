# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Work Day Scheduler
This project utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Moment to create an useful scheduling tool.<br>
When a user loads the page, they see the title and the current day, date and time at the top of the page.<br>
<br>
Below that, there are time slots for the working hours of the day, from 9AM to 5PM. To the right of each time there is a slot to add activities for that hour, and each of these slots is color coded: grey for hours in the past, red for the present hour, and green for future hours.<br>
<br>
If a user clicks on a time slot, they can add in an activity for that time. Then, if they click the time slot's corresponding "save" icon to the right, the activity will be saved to local storage<br>
<br>
The deployed application can be found here: [link to deployed application](https://okapikid.github.io/Coding-Quiz/)
